- Delete and edit request
- Admin side
- Change ssr to csr
- change auth to cookie-session
- Use auth context -- how to properly do it. (for instance displaying delete button only if it belongs to the logged in user)
- Spam email to hostel sec using sendgrid if person chooses to (would it go to spam mail??)
- anonymous complaints
- make the animations smoother using framer motion
- make sure to only take required data from db. for eg: dont take every data in the case of requests, it reveals peoples email ids and phone numbers

- use middleware for hiding restricted pages and routes
- add skeleton for loading
